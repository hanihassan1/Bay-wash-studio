##Planning/Logic and resources:
I worked on the frontend first to make the site appealing as well as responsive. Second, the database and the API calls.  JavaScript and jQuery were used in the API calls. The API’s were also used to fetch the data from the database. Mysql was used to write the queries, these queries created the database as well as the tables and then inner joining them.

 
##Technologies:
This website was developed using: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, Python3, Flask. Bootstrap theme was used, with my editions.
